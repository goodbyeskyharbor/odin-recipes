        <p>
            I'll let you in on a little secret: 
            You can make iced chai tea that competes with 
            the likes of coffee shops all around the globe
            right from the comfort of your own home. 
            Here's where it gets really good: All you
            need is chai concentrate, milk, and ice.
        </p>

            You're probably thinking, "Where am I going to find chai concentrate?"
            Well, stick around because I'm going to show you how to whip up a
            mean chai concentrate in about 5 minutes that puts the competition to 
            shame.
