        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I'll let you in on a little secret: 
            You can make iced chai tea that competes with 
            the likes of coffee shops all around the globe
            right from the comfort of your own home. 
            Here's where it gets really good: All you
            need is chai concentrate, milk, and ice.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're probably thinking, "Where am I going to find chai concentrate?"
            Well, stick around because I'm going to show you how to whip up a
            mean chai concentrate in about 5 minutes that puts the competition to 
            shame.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chai tea bags</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>2% milk for optimal thickness</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <h4>Make Chai Concentrate</h4>
            <li>Boil 1/4 cup of water in a small pot or microwave-safe cup.</li>
            <li>Add chai tea bags and steep tea for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard tea bags.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and stir until completely dissolved - add another 1/4
                cup of cold/room-temperature water (reduces concentrate room-temperature
                so it's not too warm when adding it to the milk).
            </li>
            <h4>Assemble the Drink</h4>
            <li>Fill 16-ounce cup with roughly 1 1/2 cup of ice and add milk before adding
                the chai mixture to the milk. Stir thoroughly!
            </li>
            <li>Optional: Top it off with a whipped cream of your choice!</li>
        </ol>
